<h4>About</h4>
<h2> Hi, I am Juliana, but I love it when you call me Jay. 
<p></p>
I'm an author, children stories ghost writer
and content writer with 3 year's experience. </h2>
<p></p>
<h3> I am multi-talented, as I can work with Canva
apps, make shoes but one thing I can do very well
is write.</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>I am very passionate about women and children,
hence my reason for writing for these set of
species.</h3>
<pr></pr>
<h3>Just a few months of learning Web
development, I am able to work with HTML, CSS and
JavaScript in creating simple website just like
this one you are seeing, voila!</h3>
<pr></pr>
<h3>Though, I keep learning on how to horn my skills as a web developer, I also read a lot of books to gain insight into other people's mind and concept about life. This also made me know more about what people are going through.</h3>
<pr></pr>
<h3>While I love writing generally and writing codes, I love to challenge myself by learning and doing things
that in few years will cause me to smile. One of the strengths I have as a woman is meeting deadlines, I have never had experience of not smashing my deadlines, no matter what work it is I have on my table, I meet deadlines.</h3>
<pr></pr>
<h3> As a wife and mother of two, I have a lot on my hands since the year 2020, so I have to streamline
my work so I don't burn out. 
<p></p>
You can either catch me with two types of writing: either writing my next book, content for my social media page, content for someone else, or, I am writing codes.</h3>
